CDT-plusplus
============

Causal Dynamical Triangulations in C++ using the [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library][1] and compiled with
[CMake][2] using [Clang][8]/[LLVM][3]. Follows (mostly) the [Google C++ Style Guide][14], which you can check by
running the (included in project) [cpplint.py][15] script:

~~~
# python cpplint.py <filename>
~~~

The goals and targets of this project are:

- [x] 3D Simplex
- [x] 3D Spherical simplicial complex
- [ ] 3D Toroidal simplicial complex
- [ ] 2+1 foliation
- [ ] 4D Simplex
- [ ] 4D Simplicial complex
- [ ] 3+1 foliation
- [x] Tests using [CTest][4]
- [ ] Complete test coverage
- [ ] Test builds with [CDash][5]
- [x] [Literate programming][6] generated using [Doxygen][7]
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Initialize two masses
- [ ] Shortest path algorithm
- [ ] Ergodic moves
- [ ] Metropolis algorithm
- [ ] Einstein tensor
- [ ] ???
- [ ] (Non)profit

Build:
------

CDT++ should build on any system (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) with [CMake][9] and [CGAL][10] installed. 

On MacOS, the easiest way to do this is with [HomeBrew][13]:

~~~
# brew install cmake
# brew install eigen
# brew install cgal --imaging --with-eigen3 --with-lapack
~~~

On Ubuntu, you can do this via:
~~~
# sudo apt-get install cmake
# sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
~~~

Then, download this source code (clone this repo from GitHub or grab a zipped archive [here][12]) and run the following commands in the top-level directory:

~~~
# cmake .
# make
~~~

There are also directions for doing a [parallel build using CMake][11], but currently the builds don't really take long enough to bother.

Usage:
------

`cdt [-s|-t] number_of_simplices [-d] dimensions`

Where **s** denotes spherical topology and **t** denotes toroidal topology. Currently defaults to making random spherical 3D simplicial manifolds.

Documentation:
--------------

If you have Doxygen installed you can simply type:

~~~
# doxygen
~~~

This will generate **html/** and **latex/** directories which will contain documentation generated from CDT++ source files. `USE_MATHJAX` has been enabled in [Doxyfile](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/blob/master/Doxyfile) so that the LaTeX formulae can be rendered in the html documentation using [MathJax][16]. `HAVE_DOT` is set to **YES** which allows various graphs to be autogenerated by Doxygen using [GraphViz][17]. If you do not have GraphViz installed, set this option to **NO**.


Unit tests:
-----------

You can build and run unit tests by typing:

~~~
# make tests
~~~

In addition to the command line output, you can see detailed results in the Testing directory which is generated thereby.
