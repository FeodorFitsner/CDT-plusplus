CDT-plusplus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus)
============

[Causal Dynamical Triangulations][1] in C++ using the [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library][2] and compiled with
[CMake][3] using [Clang][4]/[LLVM][5]. [Gmock 1.7][6] must also be installed in order to run unit tests.
Follows (mostly) the [Google C++ Style Guide][7], which you can check by
running the [cpplint.py][8] script:

~~~
# python cpplint.py <filename>
~~~

- [ ] (Non)profit

Prerequisites:
------

CDT++ should build on any system (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) with [CMake][14], [CGAL][15], and [Gmock][6] installed.

On MacOS, the easiest way to do this is with [HomeBrew][16]:

~~~
# brew install cmake
# brew install eigen
# brew install cgal --imaging --with-eigen3 --with-lapack
~~~

On Ubuntu, you can do this via:
~~~
# sudo apt-get install cmake
# sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev
~~~

To install Gmock, look at the [README][24]. Ubuntu users can just do:

~~~
# sudo apt-get install google-mock
~~~

But you may run into trouble because Gmock is the wrong version, or has the wrong compiler flags. I just download and build gmock-1.7 in a local directory.

Build:
------

This project uses a separate build directory. Thus, download this source code (clone this repo from GitHub or grab a zipped archive [here][17]) and run the following commands in the top-level directory:

~~~
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make
~~~

(Or run `build.sh`)

If you want to turn debugging stuff on or off, use:

~~~
# cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
~~~

or:

~~~
# cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
~~~

And then type `make` as usual.

This should result in the main program executable, `cdt`, as well as the unit test executable, `unittests`, in the build directory. If you want to install the program, you will eventually be able to run `make install`.

For some versions of Linux, you may have to build CGAL from source. Follow the instructions (or their equivalent) given in the install section of the [.travis.yml](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/blob/master/.travis.yml) buildfile.

There are also directions for doing a [parallel build using CMake][18], but currently the builds don't really take long enough to bother.

Usage:
------
CDT-plusplus uses [GNU getopt_long][19], and so understands long or short argument formats, provided the short argument given is an unambigous match to a longer one. Typing just the program generates the usage message:

~~~
# ./cdt
Usage: ./cdt
Required arguments: (you can use abbreviations)
--spherical or --periodic or --toroidal
(periodic and toroidal are the same thing)
--number-of-simplices (int) <number-of-simplices>
--timeslices (int) <number-of-timeslices>
Optional arguments:
--dimensions (int) <dimensions> (defaults to 3)
Currently, number of dimensions cannot be higher than 3.`
~~~

`./cdt --spherical --time=25 --number-of-simplices=5000`

Generates a simplicial complex with 25 timeslices of 5000 simplices with spherical topology.

`./cdt --p --time 50 -n 5000`

Does the same but with periodic (toroidal) topology.

The dimensionality of the spacetime is such that each slice of spacetime is `d-1`-dimensional, so setting `d=3` generates 2 spacelike dimensions and one timelike dimension. Thus a `d`-dimensional simplex will have some `d-1` sub-simplices that are purely spacelike (all on the same timeslice) as well as some that are timelike (spans two timeslices).

Documentation:
--------------

If you have Doxygen installed you can simply type:

~~~
# doxygen
~~~

This will generate **html/** and **latex/** directories which will contain documentation generated from CDT++ source files. `USE_MATHJAX` has been enabled in [Doxyfile](https://github.com/acgetchell/CDT-plusplus/blob/master/Doxyfile) so that the LaTeX formulae can be rendered in the html documentation using [MathJax][20]. `HAVE_DOT` is set to **YES** which allows various graphs to be autogenerated by Doxygen using [GraphViz][21]. If you do not have GraphViz installed, set this option to **NO**.


Unit tests:
-----------

You can build and run integration tests by typing:

~~~
# make test
~~~

In addition to the command line output, you can see detailed results in the Testing directory which is generated thereby.

Python Bindings:
----------------

[Cgal-bindings][9] can be installed pretty easily once [SWIG][23] is installed:

~~~
# git clone https://code.google.com/p/cgal-bindings/
# cd cgal-bindings
# cmake .
# make
~~~

Be sure to edit CMakeLists.txt and set Java binds to off:

~~~CMake
option( BUILD_JAVA "Build Java bindings" OFF )
~~~

Now, set an appropriate value of [PYTHONPATH][22] and you're [good to go](simple_triangulation_3.py)!

~~~bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/cgal-bindings/build-python
~~~

Unfortunately, at this time the Python bindings lack several functions (such as `CGAL::Random_points_in_sphere_3<T>`) that are necessary to build up simplices.
